Run ansible ad-hoc commands

ansible host01 -i inventory.txt -m command -a date

ansible host01 -i inventory.txt -m command -a pwd

ansible host01 -i inventory.txt -m command -a "nslookup 8.8.8.8"

ansible host01 -i inventory.txt -m ping
host01 | success >> {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

Run ansible ad-hoc commands on group of hosts
ansible group -i inventory.txt -m command -a date

ansible group -i inventory.txt -m command -a pwd

ansible group -i inventory.txt -m command -a "nslookup 8.8.8.8"

ansible group -i inventory.txt -m ping
host01 | success >> {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

To disable host key checking go to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and uncomment host_key_checking = False line. Not recommended
